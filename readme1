following the disussion with Joerg, we use the paper by Bernd G. Pfrommer, Michel Côté, Steven G. Louie, and Marvin L. Cohen 
with title "Relaxation of Crystals with the Quasi-Newton Method".
aster seeeing the CASTEP code that already use this paper for relaxing the strucutre while preserving its symmetry, we found out that 
we must average in all back and forth rotation symmetry operation on stress matrix.
